The `UserBotLatencyLogObserver` measures the time between when a user stops speaking and when the bot starts responding, providing metrics for conversational AI performance optimization.

## Features

- Tracks user speech start/stop timing
- Measures bot response latency
- Calculates statistics: average, minimum, maximum
- Provides real-time latency logging
- Automatically resets between conversation turns

## Usage

### Basic Latency Monitoring

Add latency monitoring to your pipeline:

```python
from pipecat.observers.loggers.user_bot_latency_log_observer import UserBotLatencyLogObserver

task = PipelineTask(
    pipeline,
    params=PipelineParams(
        observers=[UserBotLatencyLogObserver()],
    ),
)
```

## How It Works

The observer tracks conversation flow through these key events:

1. **User starts speaking** → Resets latency tracking
2. **User stops speaking** → Records timestamp
3. **Bot starts speaking** → Calculates and logs latency
4. **Pipeline ends** → Reports session latency statistics

## Log Output

### Real-time Latency Logs

During conversation, each response latency is logged:

```
⏱️ LATENCY FROM USER STOPPED SPEAKING TO BOT STARTED SPEAKING: 1.234s
```

### Final Statistics

When the pipeline ends, comprehensive statistics are reported:

```
⏱️ LATENCY FROM USER STOPPED SPEAKING TO BOT STARTED SPEAKING - Avg: 1.456s, Min: 0.892s, Max: 2.103s
```

## Limitations

- Only measures speech-to-speech latency (not text processing time)
- Requires proper frame sequencing to work accurately
