You can run commands with the `pipecatcloud` or `pcc` command (for short).

<ParamField path="pcc --version">
  Show the currently installed version of the Pipecat Cloud CLI.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="pcc --help">
  Show a list of available commands for the Pipecat Cloud CLI.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="pcc --config">
  Show the current configuration settings for the CLI (including an overrides.)
</ParamField>

## Local user config

CLI configuration is stored in `~/.config/pipecatcloud/pipecatcloud.toml` by default. You can override this location by setting the `PIPECAT_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

The local configuration file stores the following information:

- Access token
- The currently active namespace / organization
- Default API keys and settings for each organization

It takes precedence over environment variables, but not command-line flags.

  <Warning>We do not recommend manually editing the configuration file. Should the file become malformed, please run `pcc auth logout` to reset.</Warning>
  ```toml
    token = "..."
    org = "user-namespace"

    [another-user-org]
    default_public_key = "pk_..."
    default_public_key_name = "Test Key"

    [futher-user-org]
    default_public_key = "pk_..."
    default_public_key_name = "Pipecat Cloud Public Key"
    ```
