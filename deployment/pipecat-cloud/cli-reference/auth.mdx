The `auth` command group manages authentication with Pipecat Cloud, allowing you to login, logout, and check your current account identity.

## login

Begins an authorization flow to authenticate with Pipecat Cloud.

**Usage:**

```shell
pcc auth login [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

<ParamField path="--headless / -h" type="boolean" default="false">
  Skip opening a browser window for authentication and print the URL instead.
  Useful for remote or containerized environments.
</ParamField>

This command initiates the authentication process by:

1. Generating a unique authentication URL
2. Opening your default web browser (if available)
3. Waiting for you to complete the sign-in process in the browser
4. Retrieving and storing your access token locally

If the browser doesn't open automatically, or if you use the `--headless` option, you can copy and paste the displayed URL into your browser manually.

On successful login, the CLI will store the access token in the local configuration file (defaults to `~/.config/pipecatcloud/pipecatcloud.toml`). This token will be used for all subsequent requests to the Pipecat Cloud API.

You can override the default location by setting the `PIPECAT_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

## logout

Signs out of the current Pipecat Cloud account by removing the access token from your local configuration file.

**Usage:**

```shell
pcc auth logout
```

## whoami

Displays information about the currently authenticated user, including user ID, active organization, and Daily API key.

**Usage:**

```shell
pcc auth whoami
```
