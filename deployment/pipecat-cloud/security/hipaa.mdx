---

Pipecat Cloud provides HIPAA-compliant infrastructure for healthcare applications that need to process Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Infrastructure Compliance

Pipecat Cloud's infrastructure meets HIPAA controls for:

- Data processing
- Data transmission
- Secure handling of PHI

## Data Logging with HIPAA Controls

When HIPAA controls are enabled for your account:

**No application data is logged** - This includes conversation history and any PHI that may be contained in your application logs.

**Rationale**: Pipecat follows the HIPAA "minimum necessary" rule by logging only what's essential to run the service, rather than storing your PHI data.

**Alternative logging**: Configure an independent logging solution to route your application logs to your own secure log storage system.
