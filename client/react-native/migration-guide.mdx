---

This guide covers migrating from RTVIClient to the new `PipecatClient` in a React Native application. The new client introduces simplified configuration and improved client-server messaging. For an overview of the changes, see the top-level [RTVIClient Migration Guide](https://docs.pipecat.ai/client/migration-guide).

## Key Changes

<Tip>
As primarily a wrapper around the JavaScript SDK with a unique Transport, the changes are the same as those in the [JavaScript migration guide](/client/js/migration-guide) with only the following transport-specific updates. PLEASE REFER TO THE JAVASCRIPT MIGRATION GUIDE FOR FULL DETAILS.
</Tip>

### 1. Transport Configuration

Same as with the JavaScript transports, the `RNDailyTransport` now accepts a constructor argument, allowing for providing a [Daily configuration](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rn-daily-js/daily-call-client/properties).

**Old**
```javascript
const client = new RTVIClient({
  transport: new RNDailyTransport(),
  ...
});
```
**New**
```javascript
const client = new PipecatClient({
  transport: new RNDailyTransport({
    userName: 'Tina',
    reactNativeConfig: { disableAutoDeviceManagement: { audio: true } },
  }),
});
```

### 2. Connection Methods

Again, same as with the JavaScript transport, you can provide a [Daily configuration](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rn-daily-js/daily-call-client/properties) via one of the connection methods (`connect()` or `startBotAndConnect()`) on the `PipecatClient`.

**Old**

```javascript
await client.connect();
```

**New**

There are three options for connecting now. For migration purposes, you are likely to use option 3 (`startBotAndConnect()`):

1. **Direct Connection**: Provide the connection details directly to `connect()`.
```javascript
const cxnDetails = {
  url: 'https://your-daily-room-url',
  token: 'your-daily-token',
  userData: { favoriteFlower: 'black-eyed susan' },
};
await client.connect(cxnDetails);
```

2. **Using startBot()**: Fetch connection details from an API endpoint and pass them to `connect()`.
```javascript
let cxnDetails = await client.startBot({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:7860/connect',
  requestData: {
    // Any custom data your /connect endpoint requires
    llm_provider: 'openai',
    initial_prompt: "You are a pirate captain",
    // Any additional data
  }
});
cxnDetails = modifyCxnDetails(cxnDetails); // Modify if needed
await client.connect(cxnDetails);
```

3. **Using startBotAndConnect()**: Fetch connection details and connect in one step.

<Note>
  When using `startBotAndConnect()`, the response from your endpoint is passed directly to the transport and should match the Daily configuration type.
</Note>
```javascript
await client.startBotAndConnect({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:7860/connect',
  requestData: {
    // Any custom data your /connect endpoint requires
    llm_provider: 'openai',
    initial_prompt: "You are a pirate captain",
    // Any additional data
  }
});
```
