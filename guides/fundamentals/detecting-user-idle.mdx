title: "Detecting Idle Users"
description: "Learn how to detect and respond when users are inactive in conversations"

## Overview

In conversational applications, it's important to handle situations where users go silent or inactive. Pipecat's `UserIdleProcessor` helps you detect when users haven't spoken for a defined period, allowing your bot to respond appropriately.

## How It Works

The `UserIdleProcessor` monitors user activity and:

1. Starts tracking after the first interaction (user or bot speaking)
2. Resets a timer whenever the user speaks
3. Calls your custom callback function when the user is idle for longer than the timeout period
4. Provides a retry counter to track consecutive idle periods
5. Allows you to implement escalating responses or gracefully end the conversation

<Note>
  The processor uses speech events (not audio frames) to detect activity, so it
  requires an active speech-to-text service or a transport with built-in speech
  detection.
</Note>

## Basic Implementation

### Step 1: Create a Handler Function

First, create a callback function that will be triggered when the user is idle:

```python
# Simple handler that doesn't use retry count
async def handle_user_idle(processor):
    # Send a reminder to the user
    await processor.push_frame(TTSSpeakFrame("Are you still there?"))

# OR

# Advanced handler with retry logic
async def handle_user_idle(processor, retry_count):
    if retry_count == 1:
        # First attempt - gentle reminder
        await processor.push_frame(TTSSpeakFrame("Are you still there?"))
        return True  # Continue monitoring
    elif retry_count == 2:
        # Second attempt - more direct prompt
        await processor.push_frame(TTSSpeakFrame("Would you like to continue our conversation?"))
        return True  # Continue monitoring
    else:
        # Third attempt - end conversation
        await processor.push_frame(TTSSpeakFrame("I'll leave you for now. Have a nice day!"))
        await processor.push_frame(EndFrame(), FrameDirection.UPSTREAM)
        return False  # Stop monitoring
```

### Step 2: Create the Idle Processor

Initialize the processor with your callback and desired timeout:

```python
from pipecat.processors.user_idle_processor import UserIdleProcessor

user_idle = UserIdleProcessor(
    callback=handle_user_idle,  # Your callback function
    timeout=5.0,               # Seconds of inactivity before triggering
)
```

### Step 3: Add to Your Pipeline

Place the processor after speech detection but before context handling:

```python
pipeline = Pipeline(
    [
        transport.input(),
        stt,                         # Speech-to-text
        user_idle,                   # Add idle detection here
        context_aggregator.user(),
        llm,
        tts,
        transport.output(),
        context_aggregator.assistant(),
    ]
)
```

## Best Practices

- **Set appropriate timeouts**: Shorter timeouts (5-10 seconds) work well for voice conversations
- **Use escalating responses**: Start with gentle reminders and gradually become more direct
- **Limit retry attempts**: After 2-3 unsuccessful attempts, consider [ending the conversation](/learn/pipeline-termination) gracefully by pushing an `EndFrame`

Implementing idle user detection improves the conversational experience by ensuring your bot can handle periods of user inactivity gracefully, either by prompting for re-engagement or politely ending the conversation when appropriate.
