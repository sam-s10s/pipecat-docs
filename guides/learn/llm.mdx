**LLM services** are responsible for chat completions and tool calling based on the provided context (conversation history). The LLM responds by streaming tokens via `LLMTextFrame`s, which are used by subsequent processors to create audio output for the bot.

## Pipeline Placement

The LLM instance should be placed after the user context aggregator and before any downstream services that depend on the LLM's output stream:

```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    transport.input(),
    stt,                           # Creates TranscriptionFrames
    context_aggregator.user(),     # Processes user context → creates OpenAILLMContextFrame
    llm,                           # Processes context → streams LLMTextFrames
    tts,                           # Processes LLMTextFrames → creates TTSAudioRawFrames
    transport.output(),
    context_aggregator.assistant(),
])
```

**Frame flow:**

- **Input**: Receives `OpenAILLMContextFrame` containing conversation history
- **Processing**:
  - Analyzes context and generates streaming response
  - Handles function calls if tools are available
  - Tracks token usage for metrics
- **Output**:
  - Denotes the start of the streaming response by pushing an `LLMFullResponseStartFrame`
  - Streams `LLMTextFrame`s containing response tokens to downstream processors (enables real-time TTS processing)
  - Ends with an `LLMFullResponseEndFrame` to mark the completion of the response
- **Function calls:**
  - `FunctionCallsStartedFrame`: Indicates function execution beginning
  - `FunctionCallInProgressFrame`: Indicates a function is currently executing
  - `FunctionCallResultFrame`: Contains results from executed functions

## Supported LLM Services

Pipecat supports a wide range of LLM providers to fit different needs, performance requirements, and budgets:

### Text-Based LLMs

Most LLM services are built on the OpenAI chat completion specification for compatibility:

**Compatible APIs**: Any OpenAI-spec compatible service can be used via the `base_url` parameter.

### Speech-to-Speech Models

For lower latency, some providers offer direct speech-to-speech models:

- **OpenAI Realtime**: Direct speech input/output with GPT models
- **Gemini Live**: Real-time speech conversations with Gemini
- **AWS Nova Sonic**: Speech-optimized models on Bedrock

## LLM Service Architecture

### BaseOpenAILLMService

Many LLM services use the OpenAI chat completion specification. Pipecat provides a `BaseOpenAILLMService` that most providers extend, enabling easy switching between compatible services:

```python
from pipecat.services.openai.llm import OpenAILLMService

# Native OpenAI
llm = OpenAILLMService(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# OpenAI-compatible service via base_url
llm = OpenAILLMService(
    api_key=os.getenv("OTHER_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://api.other-provider.com/v1"  # Custom endpoint
)
```

This architecture allows you to quickly plug in different LLM services without changing your pipeline code.

## LLM Configuration

### Service-Specific Configuration

Each LLM service has its own configuration options. For example, configuring OpenAI with various parameters:

```python
from pipecat.services.openai.base_llm import BaseOpenAILLMService
from pipecat.services.openai.llm import OpenAILLMService

llm = OpenAILLMService(
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    model="gpt-4",
    params=BaseOpenAILLMService.InputParams(
        temperature=0.7,            # Response creativity (0.0-2.0)
        max_completion_tokens=150,  # Maximum response length
        frequency_penalty=0.5,      # Reduce repetition (0.0-2.0)
        presence_penalty=0.5,       # Encourage topic diversity (0.0-2.0)
    ),
)
```

### Base Class Configuration

All LLM services inherit from the `LLMService` base class with shared configuration options:

```python
llm = YourLLMService(
    # Service-specific options...
    run_in_parallel=True,  # Whether function calls run in parallel (default: True)
)
```

**Key options:**

- **`run_in_parallel`**: Controls whether function calls execute simultaneously or sequentially
  - `True` (default): Faster execution when multiple functions are called
  - `False`: Sequential execution for dependent function calls

## Event Handlers

LLM services provide event handlers for monitoring completion lifecycle:

```python
@llm.event_handler("on_completion_timeout")
async def on_completion_timeout(service):
    logger.warning("LLM completion timed out")
    # Handle timeout (retry, fallback, etc.)

@llm.event_handler("on_function_calls_started")
async def on_function_calls_started(service, function_calls):
    logger.info(f"Starting {len(function_calls)} function calls")
    # Optionally notify user that bot is "thinking"
    await tts.queue_frame(TTSSpeakFrame("Let me check on that."))
```

**Available events:**

- **`on_completion_timeout`**: Triggered when LLM requests timeout
- **`on_function_calls_started`**: Triggered when function calls are initiated

These handlers enable you to provide user feedback and implement error recovery strategies.

## Function Calling

LLMs can call external functions to access real-time data and perform actions beyond their training data. This enables capabilities like checking weather, querying databases, or controlling external APIs.

Function calls and their results are automatically stored in the conversation context by the context aggregator.

## Key Takeaways

- **Pipeline placement matters** - LLM goes after user context, before TTS
- **Token streaming enables real-time responses** - no waiting for complete generation
- **OpenAI compatibility** enables easy provider switching
- **Function calling extends capabilities** beyond training data
- **Configuration affects behavior** - tune temperature, penalties, and limits
- **Services are modular** - swap providers without changing pipeline code
